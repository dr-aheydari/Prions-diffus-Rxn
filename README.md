# Prions Diffusion Reaction

This project is in direct collaboration with **Prof. Suzanne Sindi** and **Prof. Maxime Theillard**. In this project, we aim to simulate the inner cellular dynamics of two species in a *dividing* yeast cell. We are in the process of pubishing the paper/code, therefore the full code and libraries are not provided.

# More will be added on to this document as we develop the project
this document will keep being updates as we keep adding more information about the project and the code
